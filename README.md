  ## Description:
  A mysql database and application backend for an e-commerce site. 

  ## Installation:
  The user should clone the repository and make sure express and inquirer are installed.  Should the user decide to test anything, be sure that jest is installed and that 'test: jest' is in the package.json file

  ## Usage:
  If your starting the code for the first time be sure to run 'npm run seed' so that the data in the seed folder is propogated in the server.  Using Insomnia (or a similar app) you can GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data.
